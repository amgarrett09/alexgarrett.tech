      <p>
        <strong>Challenge</strong>: I needed a web-site and a blog to showcase
        the projects I'm working on. The blog app needed to allow me to easily
        create, edit, and publish posts, all while having good security.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>: I built a blog app from the ground up with
        the help of the Django web framework. I learned about MVC-style web
        development, writing models to handle database entries, and using Python
        functions to serve the content to the user. I implemented forms for
        post-creation that have Markdown support, and on the back-end there is
        robust validation and HTML-escaping to prevent cross-site scripting and
        similar attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Result</strong>: The blog on alexgarrett.tech is fast and
        reliable application that has exactly the features I need without bloat.
        Additionally, the app is secure, preventing XSS and CSRF attacks. In the
        process of building it I also became quite familiar with Django and
        Python.

      <h1>Audible Sights</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenge</strong>: I was fascinated by research on
        neuroplasticity which appeared to show that humans (and other animals)
        who lose their sight can learn to "see" with other senses. I wanted to
        create a web app that would illustrate how "seeing with sound" might
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>: I used vanilla JavaScript and the browser's
        Web Audio API to convert images to sound. Image brightness data is
        converted into gain values which are fed to numerous Web Audio
        oscillators. The gain data is updated by scanning images left to right.
        I used ES6 classes to make the image conversion its own module with a
        relatively simple API, and I used Webpack to compress the JavaScript
        files and to transpile them to an older version of JavaScript with more
        compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Result</strong>: Audible Sights is a good proof of concept which
        shows how devices or apps which help the blind see with their ears could
        work. Users can try out the conversion on pre-set demo images, or upload
        their own images to experience what they sound like. The API for the
        image conversion itself is also easy-to-use and the image conversion
        module could be easily reused if the app's features were to be expanded.

      <h1>Hockey Scrub</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenge</strong>: I wanted to build a fast and easy to use
        stat tracking app to allow users to quickly look up info about current
        and past players in the National Hockey League, with a cleaner and more
        pleasant experience than some other, similar applications. I also wanted
        to implement a very fast player search with autocompletion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>: I used the React and the Next.js framework to
        build the UI and general app structure, and reached out to the NHL's own
        stats API to fetch player stats. For the player search component, I
        wrote an autocompletion library that uses a prefix trie data structure
        for efficient generation of suggestions. The autocompletion is
        implemented as part of a REST API, which the front-end player search
        component fetches from.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Result</strong>: Hockey Scrub is an app where users can very
        quickly and easily look up players and their stats, and the experience
        is snappy and satisfying. The UI has minimal clutter and is quite
        readable. The app is effective as a quick reference, and in the future I
        want to expand the number of stats it tracks. With React's modular
        nature, that should be pretty straightforward.
